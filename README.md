# Artifical Intelligence Uni Project 
## Description
The premise of the subject's project was to predict some metric based on data. In my case, I decided to use [Kaggle's CVD Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci) and a common Perceptron Neural Network to predict heart disease.

I got around 90% precision and a decent confusion matrix.
